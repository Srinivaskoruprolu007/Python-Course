#  tuples are immutable data type in python
# once defined a tuple elements can't be altered or modified

a = ()  # empty tuple
print(a)
myTuple = (3, 6, 7)
print(myTuple)
print(type(myTuple))
# if my tuple only having single value it will result  their respective data type
num = (4) # it is not a tuple data type
print(num)
print(type(num))  # it will result int data type
